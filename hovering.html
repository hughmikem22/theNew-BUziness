        <p> Intelli-Flavoring is a unique, yet extemely confidential technology. 
            what ever flavoring you think you want you burger to taste like,
            it shall taste that way. So if you think mac'n'cheese, thats what you get
            if you think strawberry, well thats what you get. There is no limit to
            flavoring.
